8. Is it true that people 50 or older average twice the charges as the average of people 20 and younger?

10. We think that having more children is a lower charge per child.  Is this true?
    - Group the records by number of children (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). (Skip 0 children, cant divide by 0) 
    - For each group find the average charge per child (total charges / total children).

18. I keep reading (that sadly) southerns average higher BMI than northerns.  At what average BMI is this true for the data set?

20. Calculate the simple linear regression of the charges versus BMI.  Output the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r).  Apply your regression formula to 11 charges that are not in the Kaggle dataset and output both the x and y values.

22. Calculate the simple linear regression of the charges versus the region.  Output the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r).  Apply your regression formula to 33 charges that are not in the Kaggle dataset and output both the x and y values.
