    # First 6 tasks to be completed:
    # SWE will be completing (2, 4, 6)  and the tester will be completing (1, 3, 5) 
    # 1. Write code that stores the first N records of the dataset in some custom object.
        # Create a file that has one class that represents the record
        # In the driver, read the data from insurance.cvs file and store it in a list of objects

    # 2. Write code that calculates the count, mean, std, min, percentiles (25%, 50%, 75%) 
    #    and max of the age, bmi, children, and charges attributes.
        # Create another file that has all the functions that handle these calculations

    # 3. Write code that displays a horizontal text-based histogram of the ages. Remember, you can't use any plotting libraries.
    # 4. Write code that displays a vertical text-based histogram of the bmi. Remember, you can't use any plotting libraries.
        # I think #3 and #4 should all be in one graphing file

    # 5. Write code that determines the total number of records for each number of children.
        # This should be in the calculations file 
        # maybe a total function that returns a dictionary with the number of children as the key 
        # and the total number of records as the value

    # 6. Write code that displays a vertical text-based histogram showing the number of smokers and the number of non-smokers.
        # I think this will just be a function call in the driver that calls a function in the graphing file 
        # with the number of smokers and non-smokers as arguments.
