Task 6
Feature: Smoker vs Nonsmoker Histogram 
Test 1
Arrange: Nake a dataset of insurance records that include smokers and nonsmokers

Task 8
Feature: Age Group Comparison 
Test 1
Arrange: Make a dataset of insurance records includes ages and charges for people both under 20 and over 50

Assert: The console prints the average charges for both groups
-----------
Task 10
Feature:Charges vs Number of Children
Test 1
Arrange: Make a dataset with number of children and total charges
Act: Find the average charge per child for each family size
Assert: The output shows if more children mean lower charge per child

Task 12
Feature: Southern Smoker Charges
Test 1
Arrange: Make a dataset with region, smoker status, and charges
Act: Compare average charges of southern smokers to smokers in other regions
Assert: The output shows if southern smokers pay at least 25% more
-----------

***Odd AAA Tests***

Task 1
Feature: Store the first N records of the dataset in a custom object
Test 1
Arrange: I created a small dataset of InsuranceRecord objects and added them into StoreRecords. I set N = 3.
Act: I called get_first_n_records(3) to retrieve the first 3 records.
Assert: I checked that the returned list contains exactly 3 records and that they match the first 3 records from the dataset in the correct order.
---------
Task 3
Feature: Print histogram of ages from dataset
Test 1
Arrange: A dataset of InsuranceRecord objects was created with repeated ages
Act: An AgeHistogram object was created with this dataset and the print_histogram() method was called.
Assert: The printed histogram displayed one line per unique age, in sorted order, with the correct number of * matching the count of each age.

Task 5
Feature: Print histogram of children counts from dataset
Test 1
Arrange: A dataset of InsuranceRecord objects was created with varying numbers of children.
Act: A ChildrenCount object was created with this dataset and the print_children_count() method was called.
Assert: The printed output displayed one line per unique children count, in sorted order, with the correct number of * and the total in parentheses.
---------
Task 7
Feature: Check fairness of dataset by region distribution
Test 1
Arrange: A dataset of InsuranceRecord objects was created with regions assigned.
Act: A Task7 object was created with this dataset and the is_data_fair() and print_fairness() methods were called.
Assert: The fairness result correctly indicated whether the dataset was balanced across regions within the allowed threshold.

Task 9
Feature: Check charge ranges across BMI groups
Test 1
Arrange: A dataset of InsuranceRecord objects was created with varying BMI values and charges.
Act: A Task9 object was created with this dataset and the check_bmi_ranges() method was called.
Assert: The output correctly displayed the charge ranges for each BMI group and identified whether the 30â€“45 BMI group had the largest range.
