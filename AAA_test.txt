***Even AAA Tests***

Task 2
Feature:Calculate stats for age
Test 1
Arrange: I created a dataset of ages
Act: Calculate.getStatistics() method is used to calculate for needed outcomes
Assert: Checking to make sure the stats match expected outcome
---------
Feature: Calculate stats for bmi
Test 2
Arrange: I created a dataset of bmis
Act: Calculate.getStatistics() method is used to calculate for needed outcomes
Assert: Checking to make sure the stats match expected outcome 

Task 4
Feature: Vertical BMI Histogram
Test 1
Arrange: Make a dataset of insurance records that have bmi values for smokers and nonsmokers 
Act: Program calls method to generate vertical text based histograms
Assert: The console will display labeled vertical histograms that accurately represent the data
-----------
Task 6
Feature: Smoker vs Nonsmoker Histogram 
Test 1
Arrange: Nake a dataset of insurance records that include smokers and nonsmokers
Act: The program calls displaySmokerHistogram(nonSmokerCount, smokerCount) using the counts from countSmokers(records)
Assert: The console will display labeled vertical histograms that accurately represent the data

Task 8
Feature: Age Group Comparison 
Test 1
Arrange: Make a dataset of insurance records includes ages and charges for people both under 20 and over 50
Act: The program runs a method to calculate the average charges of each group and compare them
Assert: The console prints the average charges for both groups

Test 2
Arrange: Make a dataset where people 50+ have charges that average 6000 and people 20 or younger have charges that average 3000.
Act:The program calls compareAgeGroupCharges(store) on that dataset.
Assert: The console prints the counts and averages of both groups and the ratio.

-----------
Task 10
Feature:Charges vs Number of Children
Test 1
Arrange: Make a dataset with number of children and total charges
Act: Find the average charge per child for each family size
Assert: The output shows if more children mean lower charge per child

Task 12
Feature: Southern Smoker Charges
Test 1
Arrange: Make a dataset with region, smoker status, and charges
Act: Compare average charges of southern smokers to smokers in other regions
Assert: The output shows if southern smokers pay at least 25% more
-----------
Task 14
Feature: Age Distribution for Smokers
Test 1
Arrange:
Act: Make a histogram showing the age distribution of smokers
Assert: The console shows the correct age bins and labels

Task 16
Feature: Average Age of Smokers
Test 1
Arrange: Make a dataset with smoker status and age
Act: Find average age of smokers and non-smokers
Assert: The output shows if smokers are younger on average
-----------
Task 18
Feature: Southern BMI Comparison
Test 1
Arrange: Make a dataset with region and BMI data
Act: Compare average BMI in southern and northern regions
Assert: The output shows if southerners have higher BMI, with both averages

Task 20
Feature: Linear Regression of Charges vs BMI
Test 1
Arrange: Make a dataset with BMI and charges.
Act: Calculate correlation and regression between charges and BMI, then predict 11 new BMI values.
Assert: The output shows the correlation, formula, and all predicted charges.
-----------
Task 22
Feature: Linear Regression of Charges vs Region
Test 1
Arrange: Make a dataset with region and charges.
Act: Convert regions to numbers, find correlation and regression, then predict 33 new points.
Assert: The output shows the correlation, equation, and all predicted charges clearly.
